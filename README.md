# Markups

## Description
This is an app that simulates a CRUD system using HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and PrimeVue.

## How to Use
I have placed the table in the index file. You can navigate using the sidebar, but only the index page is functional at the moment. To create a markup, click the "Create Markup" button.

## Notes

- The form is created with PrimeVue.
- The app is 90% responsive; however, the navbar is not yet functional.
- I attempted to handle data management with state management libraries like Pinia and Vuex but encountered issues during installation. I tried solutions from the official websites and Nuxt module but faced errors. Consequently, I used props, although this was not the ideal solution.
- I hope that I have structured the app in the right way.
