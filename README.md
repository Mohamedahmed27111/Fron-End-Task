# Markups

## Description
This is an app that simulates a CRUD system using HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and PrimeVue.

## How to Use
I have placed the table in the index file. You can navigate using the sidebar, but only the index page is functional at the moment. To create a markup, click the "Create Markup" button.

## Important Note
If `npm i` doesn't work, try `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.

## Update Notes
- There isn't any assigned corporate data in the API.
- I forgot to disable dark mode in PrimeVue for the form theme.
- I handle data with state management using Pinia in the `stores/markup.ts` file.
